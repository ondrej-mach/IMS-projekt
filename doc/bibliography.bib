abstract = {The time dependence of social practices at specific points of the day shapes the timing of energy demand. This paper aims to assess how dependent energy-related social practices in the household are in relation to the time of the day. It analyses the 2005 UK Office for National Statistics National Time Use Survey making use of statistically-derived time dependence metrics for six social practice: preparing food, washing, cleaning, washing clothes, watching TV and using a computer. The focus is on social practices over temporal scales of different days of the week and months of the year. The main findings show that: washing has the highest value for the time dependence metric; using computers is the least time-dependent practice; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays have the highest time dependence for all practices; and certain energy-related practices have higher seasonal dependence than others.}

abstract = {Higher battery storage capacity in electric vehicles (EV) implies less need for inconvenient recharging during long trips and increases the potential gains from vehicle-to-grid (V2G) electricity supply. We present an analytical model for the intertwinement of the consumers’ choice of battery capacity and the electricity market. We show that V2G increases the consumers’ choice of battery capacity, and it may reduce the cost of owning an EV vis-à-vis a traditional car. Furthermore, V2G alleviates the capacity pressure on peak hours, and thereby reduces the need for investment in generating capacity, saving social costs. Moreover, V2G may make the difference in electricity prices between peak and off-peak hours smaller, potentially increasing social surplus further. Based on a future scenario for the Belgian electricity market, we provide a numerical illustration indicating that the savings might be substantial.}

abstract = {In today’s world, there is a need of verge of significantant transformation in Electrical Power
	System. The Vehicle-to-Gird (V2G) concept optimizes this transformation. The PEV typically has a higher
	capacity Energy Storage System (ESS). Each PEV stores approximately 5-40kWh of energy. This energy
	can be transferred to the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) and Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) as
